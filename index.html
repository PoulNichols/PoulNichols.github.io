<p style="font-size: 30px;"> About Us:</p> We are a team of four programmers (Quantis, Sami, Chris, Adam) as a part of the IT115 program taught at North Seattle College. Our mission is to provide valuable resources and engaging content that encourages outdoor adventures, a sense of community, and promotes environmental stewardship. Being based in the Seattle area, all of us got together and decided to use our programming knowledge and skills to showcase the wonders and beauty that nature has to offer the world.
