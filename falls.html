<h1>The Sparkling Waters</h1>

    <p>Waterfalls are amazing natural wonders found all over the world, each with its own unique beauty. Angel Falls in
        Venezuela is the tallest waterfall, dropping water from a height of 3,212 feet. Victoria Falls, located between
        Zimbabwe and Zambia, is known as "The Smoke that Thunders" due to its impressive width and powerful flow.</p>
    
    <p>Iguazu Falls, which stretches almost three kilometers along the border of Argentina and Brazil, is actually a series
        of hundreds of waterfalls. Niagara Falls, situated between the USA and Canada, is famous for its strong water flow
        and stunning views. Gullfoss in Iceland, known as the "Golden Falls," features a unique step-like appearance, while
        Plitvice Falls in Croatia enchants visitors with its beautiful cascades surrounded by lush forests.</p>
    
    <p>Waterfalls are formed through various processes, such as rivers eroding soft rock faster than hard rock or movements
        in the Earth's crust, and they continue to captivate people with their power and beauty.</p>
