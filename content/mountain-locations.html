 <h3>Location:</h3>

 <p>Mountain Rainier’s directions to the park's five entrances from the surrounding areas.</p>

 <h3>Northwest Entrance - By Car</h3>
 <p>Carbon River in the northwest is also open year-round via SR 165 through Wilkeson, but vehicle access is permitted only to the park entrance. Beyond this point the Carbon River Road is open to pedestrians and bicyclists. The Carbon River Ranger Station is located 5.5 miles east of the Mowich Lake (SR 165) junction.
     Another access point in the northwest is Mowich Lake. Due to heavy snowfall, it is only open in the summer and closes mid-October or with the first snowfall. </p>
    
     <h3>East Entrances - By Car</h3>
        <p>Southeast - Spring through fall road closures depend on snowfall and its removal from the roadways. Ohanapecosh on SR 123 is generally open via Hwy 12 from Yakima or Packwood from late May to early November. Access to other areas of the park from Ohanapecosh may be closed during the early and later seasons so please check the road status while making your plans. </p>  
        <h3>Northeast </h3><p>- Sunrise, White River and southbound SR 123 are accessed via SR 410 from Enumclaw. The road to Sunrise is usually open by July 1st through early September, as is the visitor center and other facilities. The road to Sunrise closes at the junction with White River Campground every night beginning in late September. It reopens each morning as conditions permit. The entire road from the junction with SR 410 to Sunrise and White River is closed for winter in mid-October or earlier with the first heavy snowfall. </p>

In winter, however, SR 123 and SR 410 are closed. For winter access to the east side of the park, visitors must use I-90 and US 12. </p>
